# Northern Light Programming Test

Please use a well-known programming language such as Perl, C++, Java, Python, or PHP to develop code that takes two input files. Both input files consist of lines sorted in lexicographically ascending order based on ASCII values. The code should produce two output files:

* The first output file should contain lines that are present in the first input file but not in the second input file.
* The second output file should contain lines that are present in the second input file but not in the first input file.
